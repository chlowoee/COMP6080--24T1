1. Added a back button:

- when a user is logged it, there is a back button to take the user to the dashboard
- when a user is logged out, it will take them back to the login page

2. Removed comment box for locked threads.

3. Added a top border between comments to distinguish them easily

4. Made the comment text box wide + high so that the user can see a big chunk of their comment
