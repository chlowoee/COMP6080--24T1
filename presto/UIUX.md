UX:
Basic Visual Design Principles:
1. Presentation cards are aligned using a grid
2. Only 1 main font is used to reduce confusion. However, buttons are in uppercase to help distinguish labels from buttons. 
3. I have used a blue/white colour pallete with three main colours dark blue for toolbars, light blue for the slide element's toolbar and white for backgrounds. Black and grey are also used for buttons and text. For the two different blues, I used harmonious colours since both blues have the same hue (231).

Visual Hierachy: 
1. On the login page, colour (blue) is used to show that the Login button is more important, than the Register button is white. Similarly contrast is used on the login toolbar to draw attention to the back button and title. 

2. On the dashboard size and large margins are used to show that the presentation cards are important/ 

3. On the edit screen there are two toolbars, the main (dark blue) toolbar which handles overall presentation changes and the secondary (light blue) toolbar for adding elements to the current slide + previewing. Visual hierachy was considered here to make it easy for users to find all necessary tools. Repetition of the buttons on each toolbar puts their actions on the same level. 

Affordances: 
1. Explicit affordances were considered through icons and labels on buttons which tells the user exactly what the button does.
2. The slideshow deck uses a hamburger icon which is a pattern affordance and imples that it opens. 
3. False affordances were completely avoided to ensure users are not confused. 

UI:
1. On the dashboard, for each presentation card there is a delete button so that it is easier for the user to delete a presentation (they dont have to click onto the presentation then click delete). 
2. The slideshow deck is togglable so that it is easier for the user to edit the main slide screen on smaller viewports. 
3. Whenever hovering over a button/presentation card it changes colour to indicated a hover.
4. Previous and Next buttons were also added below the main slide screen so that the user can easily iterate through slides without having to open the slidedeck. These buttons are greyed out when a previous/next slide doesn't exist.
5. The current slide is highlighted in grey on the slidedeck when the user is editing that slide. 
6. On important modals, the cancel/no option is highlighted in red to ensure that the user doesn't make a mistake.
