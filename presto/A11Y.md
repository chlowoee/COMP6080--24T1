Preceivability: Alt text is utilised for thumbnail images to convey the context or purpose of the image to users, particularly those reliant on screen readers or with images disabled. The alt text states what presentation the thumbnail is for.

Distinguishability:
Elements were checked for their contrast ratios and are all > 4.5:1, as a result text and interactive elements have sufficient color contrast for readability.
1. Navbar, 6.93:1
2. Buttons, 9.51:1

Operability: 
1. Pressing enter to login/register is supported after the user has filled out the final input. 
2. To edit an element, the timewindow was changed from 0.5s to 2s to make it easier for users to edit elements.

Understandability:
1. Changed the <head> of the index.html to make purpose of the site explicit.
2. Form inputs are accompanied by labels to provide clear instructions and guidance to users, regardless of their accessibility needs. Placeholders are used in login/register to give users an example of what should go in the form. 
3. Error messages are succinct and error modals only disappear once the user presses "ok". 

Robustness:
1. Interactive elements such as buttons always use their respective role. 
2. Parsability is ensured by having a doctype defined and having no duplicate IDs.
